2.5 Implementation- 3005 Final Project

The web application runs on Node.js for Backend and React.js for Frontend. 
The following technologies were used for the application: JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React and SQL. 

Instructions to run the program 
1. Move to the directory where the folder named 'project' is.
2. Open two terminals.
3. The first terminal will run the backend and the second terminal will run the frontend.

4. a. For the first terminal, type 'cd backend' on the terminal 
   b. then type 'npm install' (this installs all the dependencies. It might take a while. I apologize in advance
   if it takes a while to install the dependencies). 
   c. After it is done, then type 'npm start' on the terminal. 
   The server will be connected to the database now.

5. a. For the second terminal, type 'cd bookstore'
   b. then type 'npm install' (this installs all the dependencies. It might take a while. I apologize in advance
   if it takes a while to install the dependencies)
   c. After it is done, then type 'npm start' on the terminal. The browser should automatically open with the application. 
    If not, type 'localhost:3000' in the browser to view the application.
